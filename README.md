I recently built an Article Summarizer Application to showcase my skills and ability to create polished AI software products.

For this project, I leveraged React, OpenAI's GPT-3, RTK Query, Tailwind CSS, and other modern technologies to build an end-to-end app from scratch.

Some key highlights of what I developed include:

Initializing the app with Vite for rapid iteration
Designing a responsive, aesthetically-pleasing UI with glassmorphism using Tailwind
Implementing robust API logic with RTK Query to call the GPT-3 model
Saving interaction history in localStorage for a smooth UX
Handling form submission and errors gracefully
Enabling copy-to-clipboard with one click
Following best practices like DRY principles for clean, maintainable code
Through self-directed learning and developing this portfolio project, I've demonstrated proficiency in building performant front-end apps that utilize AI/ML backends. The experience has equipped me with in-demand skills to rapidly prototype and launch production-ready software as a solo developer.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
